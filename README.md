## Overview

This pipeline processes P&ID diagrams through a series of automated steps:

1. **Input Validation** - Validates uploaded files and formats
2. **Notes Processing** - Removes notes sections and frames from diagrams
3. **Parallel Processing**:
   - **Text Detection** - Extracts text elements using Amazon Bedrock Data Automation
   - **Symbol Detection** - Identifies symbols using SageMaker endpoints
4. **Line Detection** - Detects connecting lines using computer vision
5. **Graph Generation** - Creates structured graph representation
6. **Visualization** - Generates visualization outputs

## Cost

You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Guidance. As of December 2024, the cost for running this Guidance with the default settings in the US East (N. Virginia) region is approximately $879.00 per month for processing 100 P&ID records.

The cost for this solution primarily comes from two main components: the Inference Endpoint and the Processing Pipeline.

### Inference Endpoint

The Inference Endpoint is the primary cost driver for this solution. It uses an ml.g4dn.2xlarge instance, which has the following pricing options:

- On-Demand: $879/month
- Capacity Reservation: $323/month

### Processing Pipeline Costs (100 P&IDs/month)

The processing pipeline includes several AWS services. Here's a breakdown of the estimated monthly costs for processing 100 P&IDs per month:

| Service            | Usage Pattern     | Monthly Cost (USD) | Scaling Factor              |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Amazon Bedrock     | OCR processing    | $105               | Linear with document volume |
| AWS Step Functions | State transitions | Free tier          | Minimal until high volume   |
| AWS Lambda         | Few invocations   | $0.20              | Negligible cost             |

### Additional Costs

- **Training Sessions**: $44 per session (assuming 6-hour duration) using an ml.g6.2xlarge instance.
- **Model Storage**: $3/month for 30GB GP2 storage.

Note that these prices vary over time, these estimates are based on pricing at the time of development of the project.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.13+
- CDK CLI installed (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)

### Basic Deployment

1. **Clone and install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder-name>/cdk
   npm install
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Build the project**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This step is **required** - it syncs shared utilities between Lambda functions and compiles TypeScript.

3. **Bootstrap CDK (first time only)**:

   ```bash
   cdk bootstrap
   ```

4. **Configure infrastructure**:

   ```bash
   # Download from releases
   wget https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-piping-and-instrumentation-diagrams-digitization-on-aws/releases/download/v1.0.0/model.tar.gz

   # Upload to your S3 bucket
   aws s3 cp model.tar.gz s3://your-bucket-name/models/symbol-detection/
   cp config.json.template config.json
   ```

   **Edit `cdk/config.json` with your AWS settings:**

   ```json
   {
     "vpc": {
       "vpcId": "vpc-0707a2051b2e94275", // Your VPC ID (required)
       "subnetIds": ["subnet-xxx", "subnet-yyy"], // Private subnets in different AZs (required)
       "createVpcEndpoints": true // Recommended for security
     },
     "endpoints": {
       "sagemaker": true, // Required for symbol detection
       "bedrock": true, // Required for text detection
       "logs": true // Recommended for performance
     },
     "model": {
       "s3Uri": "s3://your-bucket/path/to/model.tar.gz" // S3 URI from releases containing the model tar
     }
   }
   ```

   **Required Configuration Steps:**
   - **Download Model**: Get the model from releases and upload to S3
   - **VPC ID**: Find your VPC ID in AWS Console → VPC → Your VPCs
   - **Subnet IDs**: Use private subnets in different Availability Zones
   - **Model S3 URI**: Upload your trained SageMaker model to S3 and provide the URI

5. **Deploy infrastructure**:

   ```bash
   # Deploy with default name (PNIDDigitization)
   cdk deploy

   # Or deploy with custom name
   export CDK_STACK_NAME="your-custom-name"
   cdk deploy
   ```

6. **Process an image**:

   ```bash
   # Upload image to input bucket
   aws s3 cp your-pnid.png s3://your-input-bucket/

   # Manually execute Step Functions
   aws stepfunctions start-execution \
     --state-machine-arn <your-state-machine-arn> \
     --input '{"image_key": "your-pnid.png", "input_bucket": "your-input-bucket", "processing_config": {}}'
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Processing

```json
{
  "image_key": "diagrams/pnid-001.png",
  "input_bucket": "my-pnid-bucket",
  "processing_config": {}
}
```

### Custom Line Detection

```json
{
  "image_key": "complex-diagram.png",
  "input_bucket": "my-bucket",
  "processing_config": {
    "line_detection": {
      "threshold": 5,
      "postprocess_params": {
        "merge_distance_threshold": 0.015
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Manual Coordinates Processing

```json
{
  "image_key": "diagram-with-notes.png",
  "input_bucket": "my-bucket",
  "processing_config": {
    "notes_processing": {
      "manual_coordinates": {
        "x": 100,
        "y": 50,
        "width": 800,

      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Cleanup

Include detailed instructions, commands, and console actions to delete the deployed Guidance.
If the Guidance requires manual deletion of resources, such as the content of an S3 bucket, please specify.

### Delete CDK Stack

1. **Delete the CDK stack**:

   ```bash
   cd cdk
   cdk destroy
   ```

2. **Confirm deletion** when prompted by typing `y`

### Manual Cleanup (if needed)

If the CDK destroy command doesn't remove all resources, manually delete:

1. **S3 Buckets**: Empty and delete the input and output buckets

   ```bash
   aws s3 rm s3://your-input-bucket --recursive
   aws s3 rm s3://your-output-bucket --recursive
   aws s3 rb s3://your-input-bucket
   aws s3 rb s3://your-output-bucket
   ```

2. **SageMaker Endpoint**: Delete the endpoint if it wasn't removed

   ```bash
   aws sagemaker delete-endpoint --endpoint-name <endpoint-name>
   aws sagemaker delete-endpoint-config --endpoint-config-name <endpoint-config-name>
   aws sagemaker delete-model --model-name <model-name>
   ```

3. **CloudWatch Log Groups**: Delete log groups if needed

   ```bash
   aws logs delete-log-group --log-group-name /aws/lambda/<function-name>
   ```

4. **VPC Endpoints**: If created, these will be automatically deleted with the stack
